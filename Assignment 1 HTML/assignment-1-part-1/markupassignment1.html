            text-align: right;

        The address class "sender" essentially separates this text
        into its own scope so we can use the style from the tutorial
        to put the sender text on the right side of the letter-->
        <address class="sender-column"> 
            <!----As mentioned we areusing "strong" or bold on Eleanor and as well
            as on tel and email.
            we are also using "br" to break the text or "return" so we can format the
            sender chunk properly-->

        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent applicaiton to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as a part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by on, in the following sections.</p>
        <!---Using header 2 for the other subject lines to make them bold and larger than
        regular paragraph text-->
        <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <!---Using an unordered list for these because the order is not really that important-->
        <ul> <!----Implemented the date times for machine date reading as required by the rubric-->
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15"> 15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer</p>
        <!---Using example website link as a redirect for more informaiton on important
        dates for the reader-->
        <p>You can find out more information about <a href="https://www.websitegoeshere.com">important university dates</a>on our website</p>
        <!---Header 2 for the same reason mentioned above-->
        <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <!---I am using an ordered list here because the order is important and it is 
        also mentioned that order is important on the sample text-->
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 increasing to 3 x 10^4.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, an danything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
        <!---Header 2-->
        <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
        <p>Yes you are right! As a part of my post-doctate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <!-----
        Description listing should be used for this part because the wrapping is different when compared to 
    other lists. This will make it so the description is intended. It just looks nicer.-->
        <d1>
            <!---dt is the description term this basically sets up the description list
            so we can later use dd (description definition) to describe the details of each term-->
            <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livesotck to be "fruitful".</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking. Arctic robot dance</dd>
            <dt>Artic Robot Dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>

    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.

    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
<!-----
For each of the different dances, the descriptions of each will be indented

    Polynesian chicken dance
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
